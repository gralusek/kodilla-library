This is final project of Kodilla course - JAVA bootcamp Developer Plus. Project contains backend of library -a REST API project.

Unfortunately, the project is not yet finished, but time has come to send the project, so it is what it is. I am willing to finish the project, by addind FrontEnd layer with Vaadin, and fixing problem with External API, as it is not working correctly. Project endpoints needs to be refractored in line with Richardson maturiy model

In order to run project, run KodillaLibraryApplication class
